# Digit-Recognition-CNN-
### This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. Implemented with TensorFlow/Keras, the model is designed to effectively recognize and predict digits from grayscale images, showcasing advanced image classification capabilities.
## **📁 About Dataset**

- **Training and Testing Data:**
  - train.csv: Contains training data with pixel values and corresponding labels.
  - test.csv: Contains test data with pixel values for prediction.
  - sample_submission.csv: Provides a sample format for submission.

## **🛠️ Getting Started**
